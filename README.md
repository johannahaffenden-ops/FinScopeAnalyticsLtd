## Data Structure & Initial Checks

The dataset consists of three relational tables:

- **finance_trends** – demographic + behavioural investment survey data  
- **customer_investments** – transaction-level investment data  
- **investment_products** – products with sustainability categories  

✔ 12,000 unique customer records  
✔ 15,000 investment transactions  

![Data Schema](https://github.com/johannahaffenden-ops/FinScopeAnalyticsLtd/blob/main/Screenshots/DatabaseSchema.jpg)

Before analysis, SQL was used for data quality assurance:
For example, 
- Validate date formats  
- Identify missing or duplicated entries  
- Standardise categorical responses  
- Confirm referential integrity between tables  

Prior to beginning the analysis, a variety of checks were conducted for quality control and familiarization with the datasets. The SQL queries utilized to inspect and perform quality checks can be found ![here](https://github.com/johannahaffenden-ops/FinScopeAnalyticsLtd/tree/main/SQL%20Queries)

# Client Investors Profile

- The **65+ age group** represents the largest share of investors (33.98%) and contributes the highest total investment value (**£15M**).  
- A strong gender imbalance is present within this segment (**£9.3M male vs £5.7M female**).  
- Mid-life groups (ages 26–55) each invest around **£6M**, indicating stable but moderate activity.  
- The **18–25 age group** shows the smallest absolute investment value (£5M) but meaningful long-term growth potential.

# Client Investors Insights

- Males show higher focus on **Returns** and **Risk-taking**, while females display a more balanced distribution across **Returns**, **Savings for Future**, and **Wealth Creation**.  
- Across all age groups, **Returns** and **Savings for Future** are the strongest motivators.  
- The **65+ group** shows the highest intention to **increase future investments**, whereas younger groups show modest but positive intentions.  
- “Planning to Decrease” responses are most common among ages **36–55**, indicating an at-risk segment for engagement.

# Investment Product vs Global Trends

- Client investments are currently concentrated in **medium- and low-sustainability products**, led by Debentures (50.97%) and Gold (34.66%).  
- High-sustainability options, particularly **Government Bonds (4.84%)****,are under-adopted.  
- This contrasts with strong global trends toward **sustainable and ESG products**, as well as increasing regulatory requirements for sustainable investing.  
- The gap between global momentum and client behaviour presents a strategic opportunity to expand the ESG product suite.

# Recommendations

Based on the findings derived, the following recommendations are proposed:

### **1. Expand Sustainable Investment Products**  
Introduce Green Bonds and broader ESG-aligned product offerings to meet rising regulatory expectations and global demand.

### **2. Tailor Strategies by Age Segment**  
Develop targeted investment strategies for the **high-value 65+ group**, while creating growth-oriented products for younger investors with long-term value potential.

### **3. Personalise Advice Using Predictive Segmentation**  
Use demographic and behavioural indicators (risk attitude, investment motivations, future plans) to deliver personalised advice and prevent disengagement among mid-life groups.
